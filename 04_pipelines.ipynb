This setup is consistent with the Bifrost asychronous model where each block is asynchronous but operations on spans/gulps within a particular block are synchronous.  The `__init__` method sets up the block and defines the ring that is to be used and the CPU core that the `main` method will be bound to when `main` is started.  The `main` method does the heavy lifting here.  Inside this method:\n",
