# The Bifrost Tutorial

A collection of examples that show how to use various features in the [Bifrost framework](https://github.com/ledatelescope/bifrost/).  Before beginning this tutorial it would be a good idea to famaliarize yourself with the framework and its concepts:

 * Bifrost is described in [Cranmer et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00720)
 * Documentation for the Python APIs can be found [here](http://ledatelescope.github.io/bifrost/)
 * There is an [overview talk of Bifrost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXH89rOVVzg) from the CASPER 2019 workshop.
